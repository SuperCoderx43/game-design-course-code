This repo is the code base for my three week Game Design course that is intended as a simultaneous intro to programming and game design. It assumes no previous coding experience, and is tailored for around 4-6 hours of work each day.

**Schedule:**
 * Week 1: Intro to Python using the Jupyter Notebook
 * Week 2: Intro to Pygame using the Spyder IDE
 * Week 3: Final Project - Design and build your own game

The course uses the Anaconda python distribution package: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
